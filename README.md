Technical project from LightBox company. Make the exact copy at the Sketch design.

The technology to use for this site was Wordpress, HTML, CSS, Boostrap. 

I was more familiar with HTML,CSS and Boostrap. I used boostrap for the grid leyout and focused on CSS as the boostrap css would not help me that much and I did not
want to mixed style.css and boostrap css. 

The design was prettu easy to make expept the contact form from boostrap I had some trouble to resize it. ALso, I would need to applu PHP or javascript for the
toggle button (mobile device) where I need to change background image.
